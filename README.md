# Fitness-Tracker

## Objective
This application uses a Mongo database to track workout activity. The user is able to log new workouts and view statistics on their past workouts. The application uses JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Mongoose.  

**Please enjoy this video demonstration of the application's functionality.**

**Note** I was unable to deploy this web application to Heroku, due to the discontinuation of the mLab Mongo add-on. I apologize for not being able to share a live deployed site with you.
